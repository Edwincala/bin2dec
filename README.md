# BIN2DEC

## Project description

This simple application automatically converts a value from binary to decimal, supporting up to 8 bits (or binary digits). It validates the input, so if you enter a digit different from 0 or 1 it will display "Error". I used React because of its reactivity instead of vanilla Javascript so that the validation is made in real time, as well as conversion, and Vite because of its great development features.

I'm planning on adding conversion to other number systems like octal or hexadecimal.
